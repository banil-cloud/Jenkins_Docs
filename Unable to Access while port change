Detailed Steps to Install and Configure Jenkins on Ubuntu with Port Change

This document provides step-by-step instructions to install Jenkins on Ubuntu, change its default port from 8080 to 9090, and resolve issues during configuration.

1. Update and Upgrade the Server

Update the package lists and upgrade the installed packages:

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y

2. Install Java 17

Jenkins requires Java to run. Install Java 17 and verify the installation:

sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk -y
java -version

Ensure the output confirms Java 17 is installed.

3. Add Jenkins Repository and Install Jenkins

Follow the official Jenkins documentation to install Jenkins:

Add the Jenkins key and repository:

curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo tee \
    /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
    https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
    /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null

Update the package list and install Jenkins:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install jenkins -y

4. Change Jenkins Port to 9090

By default, Jenkins listens on port 8080. Modify it to use port 9090:

Open the Jenkins configuration file:

sudo nano /etc/default/jenkins

Locate and update the following lines:

HTTP_PORT=9090
JENKINS_ARGS="--webroot=/var/cache/$NAME/war --httpPort=$HTTP_PORT"

Save and exit the file.

5. Restart and Enable Jenkins

Restart Jenkins to apply the configuration and enable it to start on boot:

sudo systemctl restart jenkins
sudo systemctl enable jenkins
sudo systemctl status jenkins

6. Verify Jenkins Access on Port 9090

Open your browser and navigate to:

http://<your-ubuntu-ip>:9090

If the browser shows an error, proceed to the next steps to troubleshoot.

7. Troubleshooting Steps

Stop Jenkins and Kill Existing Processes

Stop Jenkins:

sudo systemctl stop jenkins

Check for any remaining Jenkins processes:

sudo ps aux | grep jenkins

Kill any remaining Jenkins processes:

sudo kill -9 <PID>

Check and Update Systemd Service Configuration

Open the systemd configuration file:

sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/jenkins.service

Ensure the following line contains the correct port:

ExecStart=/usr/bin/java -Djava.awt.headless=true -jar /usr/share/java/jenkins.war --webroot=/var/cache/jenkins/war --httpPort=9090

Update the environment variables:

Environment="JENKINS_PORT=9090"

Save and exit the file, then reload the systemd configuration:

sudo systemctl daemon-reload

Allow Port 9090 in the Firewall

Ensure port 9090 is open and accessible:

sudo ufw allow 9090
sudo ufw reload

Start Jenkins

Restart Jenkins and check its status:

sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl status jenkins

Verify if Jenkins is listening on port 9090:

sudo ss -tuln | grep 9090

You should see output indicating that Jenkins is listening on port 9090.

8. Access Jenkins in the Browser

Open your browser and navigate to:

http://<your-ubuntu-ip>:9090

Replace <your-ubuntu-ip> with your serverâ€™s IP address. You should now be able to access Jenkins successfully.

9. Unlock Jenkins and Start Configuration

Once you access Jenkins, you will be prompted to enter an initial admin password. Find this password in:

sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

Copy the password, paste it into the browser, and proceed with the setup.
